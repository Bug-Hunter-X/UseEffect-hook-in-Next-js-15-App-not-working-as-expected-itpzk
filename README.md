# Next.js 15 useEffect Hook Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application using the `useEffect` hook. The `MyComponent`'s `useEffect` hook unexpectedly fails to trigger re-renders when the `count` state updates.  Furthermore, the cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook does not execute as expected upon component unmount.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the behavior of the counter in the browser.

## Expected Behavior

The counter should increment correctly, and console logs should indicate the component mounting and unmounting.

## Actual Behavior

The counter increments, but the console does not show the expected messages. This suggests an issue with how the `useEffect` hook is handled or a possible incompatibility with other aspects of the application.

## Potential Solutions

Investigating this issue may involve exploring the following:

* Checking for conflicting libraries or dependencies.
* Reviewing the component's lifecycle and rendering process.
* Ensuring the correct use of the `useEffect` hook's dependencies array.
* Examining browser console logs for additional error messages or warnings.
